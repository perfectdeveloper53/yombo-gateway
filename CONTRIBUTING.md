# Contributing to Yombo

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to Yombo. There is a lot to do...if
you don't know Python and you would like to help, you can contribute 
[translations](https://yombo.net/docs/translations) if you know any other
languages. If you know Python or want to learn it, you can contribute in one of these areas:

* [Integrate new protocols](https://yombo.net/docs/contributing#modules) - Create a new module to
add support for new device protocols.
* [Contribute to core](https://yombo.net/docs/contributing#core) - Add core features, fix bugs,
or update [developer documentation](https://yombo.net/docs/gateway/html/current/index.html).

* Fork the Yombo [git repository](https://github.com/yombo/yombo-gateway).
* [Kill a bug](https://github.com/yombo/yombo-gateway/issues), implement new feature,
  update documentation, etc.
* Ensure tests work.
