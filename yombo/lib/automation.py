  For more information see:
  `Atoms @ Module Development <https://yombo.net/docs/libraries/automation>`_

The automation library provides users an easy method to setup simple automation rules and tasks without the need to
write a single line of code. It can also be extended by modules to include additional platforms. See link above for
details on extending automation rule capabilities.

The automation library also doubles as a 'macro' library. This allows rules to be called through other rules or
other means, bypassing a rule trigger and filter.

There are three steps to every rule:

1) Source - A rule must be triggered by some source. A device state changes, an internal value changes, system
   status changes, etc.
2) Filters - Rules can be filtered. For example, if a rule was triggered by some source, it can be stop from
   firing it's action if certain conditions aren't met. For example, a device source such as 'motion' is detected
   outside. But, a condition check of "is sunny" is true, then don't bother turning on the light.
3) Action - Do something. In the above example, turn on a light.

A naming convention of 'platforms' is used to direct the automation system. It's just another way of saying
'atoms, devices, and states can be used as sources'. for example, atoms, states, and devices can all be platforms
for sources, filters, and actions. A state change can trigger a rule, a state value can be a condition, and a state
can be changed as an action.

*For End Users*: It's strongly recommended to visit
`Automation @ Projects.yombo.net <https://projects.yombo.net/projects/modules/wiki/Automation>`_ for details on usage
and writing automation rules.

*For developers*: This library only provides the base framework. Features are actually implemented by hooks to other
libraries and modules. Developers can extend the capabilities of the automation library using modules.

Developers should review the following modules for examples of implementation:

* :py:mod:`yombo.lib.automationhelpers` - Implements various platforms
* :py:mod:`yombo.lib.atoms` - Look near the bottom for hooks into triggers, conditions, and actions.
* :py:mod:`yombo.lib.states` - Look near the bottom for hooks into triggers, conditions, and actions.

        A public function that modules and libraries can optionally use to trigger rules. Used to track simple
        dictionary type items or things that can be contained in a dictionary.

        See the :py:mod:`devices <yombo.lib.devices>` library for best example and documentation.

        Summary: When a rule is being added, the 'add_trigger_callback' is called to the platform to add any
        triggers required. Generally, it's up to the module to perform this task. However, the 'triggers_add'
        and 'triggers_check' can perform this task.

        In devices, states, atoms, etc, when 'add_trigger_callback' is called, they all register tracked_keys with
        this function. This function creates an entry in a dictionary and can store the values.  Now, whenever a
        device status changes, states change, atoms change, they call triggers_check with the tracked_keys and
        the value. If the value's changed, :py:meth:`triggers_check <triggers_check>` will fire any rules as required.
