# Contributing to Yombo

Everybody is invited and welcome to contribute to Yombo. There is a lot to do...if
you are not a developer perhaps you would like to help with the documentation on
[yombo.net](https://yombo.net/)? If you are a developer and have devices in your home
which aren't working with Yobmo yet, why not spent a couple of hours and
help to integrate them?

The process is straight-forward.

 - Read [How to get faster PR reviews](https://yombo.net/docs/contributing/pull_requests)
 - Fork the Yombo [git repository](https://github.com/yombo/yombo-gateway).
 - Bug a bug, implement new feature, update documentation, etc.
 - Ensure tests work.
 - Create a Pull Request against the [**develop**](https://github.com/yombo/yombo-gateway/tree/develop) branch of Yombo.

Still interested? Then you should take a peek at the [developer documentation](https://yombo.net/docs/contributing)
to get more details.
