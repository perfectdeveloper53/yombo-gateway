  `Voice Commands @ Module Development <https://yombo.net/docs/libraries/voice_cmds>`_

The term "Voice commands" may be misleading. Think of voice commands as
noun/verb or verb/noun pairs to control devices. The verb is the "what",
such as which :class:`~yombo.lib.devices` or module function to send a
:class:`command <yombo.lib.commands>` to. The noun is the "command" that the
device or module should do for the given noun.

Voice commands can be sent in by any means: Speach to text app such as Siri on
iPhone, android speach to text, IM, private (or public if the user is daring)
Twitter feed, Email, SMS, text file monitor, telnet input, remote sensor, XPL,
XAP, microphone with speech to text processing capabilities, etc.

**Example**:

  For example, if a voice command has these inputs::

    Noun: living room desk lamp
    Verb: on, off, dim, bright

  Then a string of text with "living room desk light off" would parse as::

    Noun: living room desk lamp
    Verb: off

The voice commands would then generate an "off" command for device
"living room desk lamp".

Two primary actions the voice_cmd class can do:

#. Add voice commands
#. Search for voice commands

Users can set voice commands on each device. The voice commands
are loaded when the gateway starts up.  Additional voice commands can be
added by modules to add more functionality.

Usage
-----

Assume there is a module called "computerTools" that controls various
computer activities.  It could create various commands that allow it to
sleep, power offer, reset, etc. To create additional voice commands,
call the add function with a "command string". The format can either be
'noun [list of verbs]' or '[list of verbs] noun'. The command string
will be parsed the same, regardless of input styple

Can associate a command string to a specific device_id if desired,
however most modules will not set this and leave is as 0. Lastly, the
format, or order, of the voice command can be set. For noun/verb order,
such as "desklamp off", set the "order" variable to "nounverb". For
verb/noun ordering, such as "open garage", set the "order" variable to
"verbnoun". The order can also accept "both" to generate both formats,
however, over use of this will result of more false positives during
the fuzzysearch phase of voice command lookup.
*Avoid the use of "both" when possible.*

**Examples**:

  Adding a voice command for a module in noun/verb order:

  .. code-block:: python

     voice_cmds = self._Libraries['voicecmds']
     voice_cmds.add("computer [sleep, hibernate, reset, power off]", 'module.computerTools', 0, 'nounverb')

  Search for the device_id for the desklamp and get the command_id based on the action:
  
  .. code-block:: python

     from yombo.core.helpers import getVoiceCommands

     voice_cmds = getVoiceCommands()
     voice_cmds["desklamb off"] # it's misspelled, but it will still be found.
