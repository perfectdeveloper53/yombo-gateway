# COMPONENTS

The components directory contains the Vue.js Components.

The subdirectories:

* ControlTower - All components relating to the control tower
* Common - Common components to be used anywhere
* Dashboard - Components for the dashboard

Nuxt.js doesn't supercharge these components - AKA - they are not autoloaded or handled
in any way by Nuxt.
