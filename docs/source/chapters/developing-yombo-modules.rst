Extending the Yombo Gateway is easy!

Full documentation is located at
`Yombo.Net - Module Development <https://yombo.net/docs/developing_modules>`_, including
a complete example on
`building your first module <https://yombo.net/docs/developing_modules/duilding_your_first_module>_`.

An :ref:`empty <emptymodule>` module is included with the gateway to get you quickly started. Simply make a copy
of the empty module to use a framework.
